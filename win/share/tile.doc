TILE Credits
------------

Window ports can optionally make use of the tiles (pictures for NetHack
symbols) found in this directory.  They are distributed in a text format
with routines to help in converting them to a system's preferred format
and using them there.  

The original 16x16 tiles were provided by Warwick Allison.  The 16x16
tiles currently in glHack are from NetHack 3.4.0.

The 32x32 and 48x64 tilesets contain tiles from many different sets,
mainly the ones in Slash'EM (in the win/share directory).  The
majority of the tiles in glHack come from the "mi" sets, which were
created by a number of different people under the direction of
Mitsuhiro Itakura who also holds the copyright on these tiles.  
The artists were:

	Mitsuhiro Itakura
	Haruko Numata
	Edger
	ZMYDaino
	Wan'ichi
	Tatsuya

Some other 32x32 tiles came from the "alg" set, which were imported
from AllegroHack, written by Kelly Youngblood.  The artists were:

	Kelly Youngblood
	Paul Pliska
	John Harris

One or two of the 32x32 tiles are from the "aw" set which was was
contributed by Andrew Walker.

A few of the 32x32 tiles were created by me (Andrew Apted), including
the spider web, buckled boots, eucalytpus leaf, and six new floor
tiles at the end, and smoothing out some of the enlarged 16x16 tiles
(mainly traps and sokoban & gehenom walls) to make them look better.


TILE File Format
----------------

Tile files have the extension ".txt".  They start with a palette
header like:

A = (0, 0, 0)
...
P = (255, 255, 255)

and then each tile has an entry like:

# tile 292 (comment identifying tile)
{
  AAAAGHPAAAAACDAA
  AAAFGDEMLOCNAAAA
  ...
}

The color characters consist of uppercase letters, lowercase letters,
and digits.  Tile sets which require more than 62 colors can use two
character color keys (with additional `_' and `$' characters), giving
up to 4096 colors.  All keys in any one file must be the same size.

For files with two character color keys, the initial keys must begin
with a `_', allowing them to be differentated.


MODEL Spec Format
-----------------

Spec files have the extension ".tsp" (Tile SPec), and define the 3D
model information for each tile.  The tiles must match the names and
order in the 2D tileset files.  Each entry, if fully specified, would
look like:

# tile 292 (comment identifying tile)
{
  model = foobar.md2
  skin  = foobar.png
  material = FooBar
  light = FooBar
  scale = 1
  rotate = 0
  flags = ABXY
}

All keywords except "model" and "skin" can be left out and will take
on default values.

Flags are a group of letters.  The current flags are:

   R - Rotates slowly.  Used for gems and rings.
   
   F - Floor-less (a background floor should not be drawn).  Used for
       the down staircase, pits, and solid walls (where the floor
       would be hidden).
   
   M - Monsters/objects allowed.  When the midground (e.g. a fountain
       or solid wall) overlaps the foreground (monster or object),
       then the code normally draws only the foreground.  The `M' flag
       is used by midgrounds to allow the foreground to be drawn too,
       e.g. the "doorway" model.
