EdTile TODO
===========

*  t_colmap: use caching to SPEED UP lookup operations.
  
+  write w_sets (shows each TXT file).

+  write w_dialog class.

-  fix w_compact to use full window width (maximised).
   
-  convert various r/g/b parameters to use PackCols.

-  write code to "import" a tileset, i.e. map the colors in the
   imported file to those in the original TXT file.
