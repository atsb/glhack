INTRO
-----

EdTile will be an editor and browser for NetHack tile files (located
in the win/share directory and have the ".txt" extension)

NOTE: this is real bleeding edge stuff right now.  The editor in
      particular is far from being even slightly useful...


UTILITY SUMMARY
---------------

edtile
	Supposed to be a tile editor for ".TXT" files.  Currently it
        makes a pretty good tile viewer.

makeset
        Makes the final tilesets (each one is just one big PPM image)
        by loading all the individual .TXT tilesets (e.g. mon32aja +
        obj32aja + oth32aja --> gltile32.ppm).  Handles the fonts as
        well.

pngify.sh
	Converts the PPM output files from `makeset' to PNG files
        which glHack requires.

renumber
	Small utility to put all the tiles in a .TXT tileset file into
        strict numerical order (i.e. the numbers that appear on the
        #tile lines).

saveppm
	Takes a tileset (.TXT format) and writes out a PPM file
        containing all the tiles.

loadppm
	Takes a PPM image, chops it up into chunks and writes out a
        tileset (.TXT file).  Requires a colors file, for example:
        win/share/colors32.lst.
        
samecmap
	Takes a reference tileset and an input tileset, converts the
        input to use the same colormap as the reference, and writes it
        out as a new tileset (.TXT format).
